# Text_Corpus_Analysis_MultiNLI
This project aim to design and implement a Spark application to handle a relatively large data set. 

The data set used in this project is a public text corpus called Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI). The corpus consists of 433k sentence pairs in 10 genres from written and spoken English. Each pair contains a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence. The corpus is developed for a particular NLP task called Natural Language Inference. It involves building a model to automatically determine if a hypothesis sentence is true given that its premise sentence is true.
